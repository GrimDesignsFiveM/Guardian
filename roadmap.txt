The information provided here is a short-term roadmap. For longer term roadmaps, 
see https://trello.com/b/txGQqtPU/novuh-bot and https://github.com/Novuh-Bot/Guardian/projects/1.

Guardian v2: 
    - Rework userinfo command.
        • Accept user mentions
        • If no mention is provided, default to message author
    - Push music commands to seperate files
        • Create an add command, etc
        • Streamline the functionality as much as possible
    - General code style fixes

Guardian v3:
    - Decide what framework I want to code in
        • Komada vs Commando
        • Do I even want to use frameworks, or just rework the current bot?
    - Find ways to keep max amount of commands
        • rps may not be possible, etc
        • Figure out seemingly only d.js commands such as eval
        • Figure out ways to streamline commands based on frameworks
